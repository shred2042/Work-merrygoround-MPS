1. Will it work on every devices?
   It doesn't work on Nexus 4 which has android 4.*. So this works on android 5.01 or bigger.

2. Sound tests are perfect.
   Works instantly. 

3. Some easy word tests 
   Works...

4. What does it show for clicking nothing and waiting?
   It shows that "time is up"  so its good.

5. What does it show for clicking everyplace?
   It only has actions when you click exact buttons or labels.

6. Testing for Nr.of letters < 4  [SOLVED]
   It doesn't show me a warning when I enter less than 4 letters.Instead shows me "wrong word"

7. Very hard to find a word in each round.
   Letters are not well orginised. (but again it was applied by a method they wanted)

8. 
   When time is up, showing the result (points) is good. But there is also  [SOLVED]
   "Del" button which shouldn't show.
