1. Will it work on every devices?
   It doesn't work on Nexus 4 which has android 4.*. So this work on android 5.01 or bigger.

2. Sound tests are perfect.
   Works instantly. 

3. Some easy word tests 
   Works...

4. What does it show for clicking nothing and waiting?
   It shows that "time is up"  so its good.

5. What does it show for clicking everyplace?
   It only has actions when you click exact buttons or labels.

6. Nr.of letters < 4
   It doesn't show me a warning when I enter less than 4 letters.

7. Very hard to find a word in each round.
   Letters are not well orginised.

8. Didn't see the 54 faces of dice
   "In “Caruselul literelor” exista 9 “zaruri” cu cate 6 fete, pe fiecare fata este o litera. 
   Jocul are astfel 9x6 = 54 de fete (adica 54 de litere)."

9. 
   When time is up, showing the result (points) is good. But there is also
   "Del" button which shouldn't show.
